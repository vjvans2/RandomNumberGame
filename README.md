# RandomNumberGame
 - First C# project ever.  Utilized hunting for the Random class to randomize a number, knowledge of MessageBox properties, event handling, basic visual creation, and creative use of properties. <br>
 - Single form application generates a random number from 1-500 and then user has to guess the number.  Form uses MessageBox's to communicate whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.  Form keeps track of how many guesses it takes to guess number correctly.<br>
